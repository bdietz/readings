# Social Media Readings

## The #TwitterEthics Manifesto, Dorothy Kim & Eunsong Kim, Model View Culture, April 7th, 2014

> Journalists, academics and mainstream media platforms that quote out of context, quote without permission, or plagiarize are not performing acts of kindness â€” they are abusing their powers as gatekeepers. They are positioning themselves as the managers of relevant information, and disregarding the informational systems and dialogues that are organically taking place.

Geared toward journalists and marketers, not necessarily at academic libraries (but possibly academic researchers)
